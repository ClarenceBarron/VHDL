2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/nextState_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/nextState_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/currentState_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/digitOneEn_reg_i_2/O, cell SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/digitOneEn_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/currentState_reg[3]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/ledMode_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/ledMode_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/currentState_reg[3]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/digitTwoEn_reg_i_2/O, cell SYSTEM_WORKINGS/INPUT_RECEIVER/digitTwoEn_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net SYSTEM_WORKINGS/digitFourEn_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin SYSTEM_WORKINGS/digitFourEn_reg_i_2/O, cell SYSTEM_WORKINGS/digitFourEn_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net SYSTEM_WORKINGS/digitThreeEn_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin SYSTEM_WORKINGS/digitThreeEn_reg_i_2/O, cell SYSTEM_WORKINGS/digitThreeEn_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
